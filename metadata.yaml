description: Although this novel from Anthony Hope doesn''t have the same level of
  swashbuckling sword play as his best-known work, The Prisoner of Zenda, it is still
  a fast-paced, action-packed read. Containing elements of mystery and romance, The
  Secret of the Tower explores unusual goings-on in the Tower Cottage, a centerpiece
  of the small English village of Inkston.
